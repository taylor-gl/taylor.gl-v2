## SvelteKit

To run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

To build a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
